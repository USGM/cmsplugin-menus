==============================
Django CMS Menus Plugin
==============================

The Menus plugins are a collection of pluggable menus for `Django CMS <http://www.django-cms.org/>`_.

Current release is ALPHA.  Some limited testing has been done.  Please let me know if you use this module and how it works for you.

Menu types include:

* Custom Menu (Link Block): a re-usable, named block of links and/or snippets.  Useful, for example, for a "Quick Links" block, or other block of links that will be re-used on multiple pages on the site.
* Section Navigation Menu: display hierarchical navigation (nested lists) for all nodes below a given "root" 
  (any page on site - usually a section page with a child tree).  Useful for adding custom navigation blocks.
* Sitemap: simply a complete hierarchical navigation (nested lists) of all pages on the site.
 
Features
========

* Custom Menu: users add links, snippets, or other plugins (set in settings) to placeholder.
  Custom Menu's are re-usable so the same menu can be placed on several pages.
* Nav. Menu: user can select which sub-section of site to create menu for, or use current page's root by default.
* Both menus have a "collapse" option, which, if selected, adds class="collapse" to the menu so it can be collapsed using CSS or JS.
* Sitemap: template logic only plugin - simply renders show_menu tag.
* Easy to override templates and media - default CSS with collapse/expand logic included.
* Can use each plugin independently

Known Issues

Installation
============

From PyPI
---------

not yet - sorry.

Manual Download
---------------

You can download a zipped archive from http://github.com/powderflask/cmsplugin-menus/downloads.

Unzip the file you downloaded. Then go in your terminal and ``cd`` into the unpacked folder. Then type ``python setup.py install`` in your terminal.

Configuration
-------------
Add one or more cmsplugin_menu plugins to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in settings.py::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (..., 
        'cmsplugin_menus.plugins.*',  # installs all menu plugins
    )  

OR  pick and choose::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (...,
        'cmsplugin_menus.plugins.linkblock',
        'cmsplugin_menus.plugins.navigation',
        'cmsplugin_menus.plugins.sitemap',
    )
                 
Don't forget to syncdb.

Templates
---------
Recommended to use the app_directories template loader::

    TEMPLATE_LOADERS = (
        'django.template.loaders.filesystem.Loader',
        'django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader',
        ...
    )

If you aren't using the app_directories template loader, you will need to add the
templates to your TEMPLATE_DIRS settings.  The templates are at::

   cmsplugin_menus/plugins/<plugin-name>/templates

and can be overridden by adding a "cmsplugin_menus" folder to your project templates directory.
    
Media
-----
Media files for the plugins are expected at: {{ MEDIA_URL }}cmsplugin_menus/

In your MEDIA_ROOT, copy or link the cmsplugin_menus media:: 

    ln -s /path/to/cmsplugin_menus/media/cmsplugin_menus

If you want to use the default CSS, which provides basic styles and expand/collapse logic,
include a link to the css file in your base template (or whichever template will have the menu plugins on them)::

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href='{{ MEDIA_URL }}cmsplugin_menus/css/cmsplugin_menu.css' 'media="all" />


Settings
========

No settings are required, however, some default settings can be overridden:

* CMSPLUGIN_MENUS_TEXT_ENABLED = False # by default.  Set to True if menus should be available as text plugin.

* CMSPLUGIN_MENUS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF  Limits which plugins are allowed within a Custom Menu (link block)

You can override this setting to change the defaults (LinkPlugin and SnippetPlugin) in your settings like this::

    CMSPLUGIN_MENUS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF = {
        'cmsplugin_menus link block': {
                'plugins': ('LinkPlugin', 'SnippetPlugin', ...),
                'name': gettext("links")
    }}

OR::

    CMSPLUGIN_MENUS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF = None  # don't limit plugin types in link blocks

OR  add the 'cmsplugin_menus link block' entry directly::

    CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF = { 
        ..., 
        'cmsplugin_menus link block': { ... },
        ... 
    }
